# My Telegram Bot


## Description

__Welcome aboard__. My Telegram Bot is a telegram bot I am creating to help me upload files easly to my google drive from telegram.


## Why I wanted to created the bot in the first pace

In college all our learning materials, schedules and assignments are shared on telegram group. We (the sutudents) also use it for discussions, so it is not ideal to have your materials in such an unorganized manner. Also when I want to access my files from a device like a school computer, I have to signin to my telegram account then look through the group chat to find one thing which is not ideal. But if I upload my documents and assignments to my google drive, I can sign in to my drive, then I can access both my documents and assignments organized in one place.


## How it is supposed to works

I forward a file a want to to upload to th bot. I can also forward text to it or write text input directly and it will create a text file and upload it my google drive account.
